## Introduction  

### A New Era of Creation  

Imagine building a fully functional web app in *hours*, not weeks—production-ready in *days*, not months.  

This isn't a dream — it's where web development is heading, powered by agentic AI.  

::right::

- **Today's Goal**:  
  - Trace the evolution of web dev  
  - Share a vision for the future  
  - Demo rapid prototyping live  
- **Why It Matters**: Speed, accessibility, and freedom from old burdens

## Evolution & Acceleration of Web Development

### From prototype to production

- **1990s**: Static HTML/CSS—manual, slow (Months)
- **2000s**: JS, PHP, early frameworks—dynamic but labor-intensive
- **2010s**: Monolithic Frameworks (Rails, Django, Laravel, etc.) - still complex (Weeks)
- **2020s**: Low-code + AI (Copilot)—automation begins (Days)
- **2025+**: Agentic AI—fully autonomous creation (Hours)

::right::

> "From months to hours—web development accelerates. AI is the next leap."

## Developer Assistance Evolution

- **1990s**: Books, Documentation—physical manuals and reference guides
- **2000s**: Google, Forums—searchable knowledge, community support
- **2010s**: Stack Overflow, GitHub—crowdsourced solutions, code sharing
- **2020s**: ChatGPT, Copilot—contextual assistance, code completion
- **2025+**: Autonomous Agents—proactive problem-solving, full-cycle assistance

::right::

  - *Bolt.new*: Natural language to full-stack apps  
  - *Lovable.dev*: Lightweight, design-focused prototypes

::right::

- **Agent-Enhanced IDEs**:  
  - *VS Code + Plugins*: Copilot, Cline with Claude and Computer Use for visual debugging
    - Code Insiders (early access program for VS Code) for Copilot Agent
  - *Cursor*: Composer mode for agentic development and debugging (paid)
  - *GitHub Copilot*: Git commit messages, code completions, PR reviews, chat, edit mode, etc.

## Web as the Universal Runtime

- **Universal Accessibility**: Deploy once, run everywhere—desktop, mobile, tablets
- **Rapid Iteration Cycle**: Instant updates without app store approvals
- **WebAssembly Convergence**: Near-native performance for complex applications
- **JavaScript Ecosystem**: World's largest package ecosystem (npm) with 2M+ packages
- **AI Tool Integration**: Bolt, Playable, and other AI tools generate web-first solutions
- **Zero-Install Experience**: No downloads required for users—instant engagement
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Start simple, scale complexity as needed

## The Current Paradigm Shift

- **From Writing Code to Describing Intent**
  - Code as an implementation detail
  - Shifting from "how" to "what" and "why"

- **The Democratization of Creation**
  - Everyone becomes a creator

- **The Death of Frameworks**
  - Rise of composable, AI-assembled architectures

::right::
- **The Future of Web Development**:
  - **AI-Powered Prototyping**: Generate full-stack apps from natural language
  - **Web-First Solutions**: No need to choose between frameworks or platforms
  - **Progressive Enhancement**: Iterate fast and safely using AI tools in combination with CI/CD
  - **Choice of tools**: Use the tools that are proven to work best for the task at hand
  - **Efficient tool usage**: Avoid common pitfalls by using system prompts and ensuring coding best practices

## The Paradigm Shift: Agentic AI

- **From Writing Code to Describing Intent**
  - Code as an implementation detail
  - Shifting from "how" to "what" and "why"

- **Democratization of Creation**
  - Everyone becomes a creator

- **Freedom from Frameworks**
  - Rise of composable, AI-assembled architectures

::right::

> "Agentic AI promises creation without constraints."

## Benefits of This Future  

"Entire apps in hours. Production-ready in days. Accessible to all."  

- Speed  
- Scalability  
- Cost savings
- Freedom from frameworks
- Democratization of creation
- More time for what really matters

---

## Economic Impact

- Development cycles compressed: Do more with less
- Quality assurance evolution: From manual to fully automated
- Shift from scarcity to abundance: More apps, more competition
- Value shift from coding to problem-solving: Focus on what matters
- Anyone can create complex apps, thus it is getting harder to stand out

## Challenges & Best Practices  

### Keeping AI in Check  

- **Quality**: Large context windows (e.g., Lovable) risk hallucinations  
  - *Solution*: Early CI with Playwright testing  
- **Cost**: Big contexts inflate inference costs  
  - *Solution*: DRY, Single Responsibility—keep it lean  
- **Efficiency**:
  - *Solution*: Refactor early and often, use the right tool for debugging

> "AI speeds us up; timeless practices keep us grounded."

## Enhancing AI Workflows  

### Smarter Systems  

- **System Prompts**:
  - "UI testing: Wait for element X instead of adding timeouts"
  - "Code refactoring: Follow DRY and Single Responsibility principles"
- **Cursor Composer**:  
  - Uses screenshots to validate tests and fix issues  

::right::

> "Precision in prompts avoids spaghetti code."  

---

## Continuous Integration for AI-Generated Projects

- Trunk based vs feature branches
- Early automated ui-testing with Playwright
- Screenshot-based debugging with Cursor Composer
- Continuous integration with GitHub Actions or CircleCI

---

## Flashcards App  

- *Claude AI*: "Help me conceptualizing a web app that helps students learn by creating flashcards."
- *Playable.dev*: Use prompt from Claude to create a prototype. Upload to GitHub after creation.
- *Cursor (composer and cline)*:
  - Retrieve code from GitHub
  - Cline: Add playwright tests using Claude Computer Use and fix bugs
  - Add features like elevenlabs TTS and openai to generate flashcards.
  - Safely iterate using UI testing, use screenshots for debugging
