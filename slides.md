# Introduction  
## A New Era of Creation  

Imagine building a fully functional web app in *hours*, not weeks—production-ready in *days*, not months.  

This isn't a dream—it's where web development is heading, powered by agentic AI.  

::right::

- **Today's Goal**:  
  - Trace the evolution of web dev  
  - Share a vision for the future  
  - Demo rapid prototyping live  
- **Why It Matters**: Speed, accessibility, and freedom from old burdens

# Evolution & Acceleration of Web Development

- **1990s**: Static HTML/CSS—manual, slow (Months)
- **2000s**: JS, PHP, early frameworks—dynamic but labor-intensive
- **2010s**: Rails, React, Angular, DevOps—modular, still complex (Weeks)
- **2020s**: Low-code + AI (Copilot)—automation begins (Days)
- **2025+**: Agentic AI—fully autonomous creation (Hours)

::right::

> "From months to hours—web development accelerates. AI is the next leap."

# Current State  
## AI-Assisted Development  

- **Rapid Prototyping Tools**:  
  - *Bolt.new*: Natural language to full-stack apps  
  - *Lovable.dev*: Lightweight, design-focused prototypes  
- **Agent-Enhanced IDEs**:  
  - *VS Code + Plugins*: Copilot, Cline for automation  
  - *Cursor*: Real-time code suggestions  

"These tools slash dev time—prototypes in hours, not weeks."  

---

# The Paradigm Shift: Agentic AI

- **From Writing Code to Describing Intent**
  - Code as an implementation detail
  - Shifting from "how" to "what" and "why"

- **Democratization of Creation**
  - Everyone becomes a creator

- **Freedom from Frameworks**
  - Rise of composable, AI-assembled architectures

::right::

> "Agentic AI promises creation without constraints."

# Benefits of This Future  

"Entire apps in hours. Production-ready in days. Accessible to all."  

- Speed  
- Scalability  
- Cost savings  

Imagine what this means for education: tools built fast, used everywhere.

# Challenges & Best Practices  
## Keeping AI in Check  

- **Quality**: Large context windows (e.g., Lovable) risk hallucinations  
  - *Solution*: Early CI with Playwright testing  
- **Cost**: Big contexts inflate inference costs  
  - *Solution*: DRY, Single Responsibility—keep it lean  

"AI speeds us up; timeless practices keep us grounded."

# Enhancing AI Workflows  
## Smarter Systems  

- **System Prompts**:  
  - Poor prompt: "Add a timeout" → anti-pattern  
  - Better: "Wait for element X" → reliable tests  
- **Cursor Composer**:  
  - Uses screenshots to validate tests and fix issues  

::right::

> "Precision in prompts avoids chaos in code."  

---

# Vision for the Near Future (2025-2030)

- **Conversation-to-Production Pipeline**
  - Verbal descriptions to production code

- **Continuous AI Optimization**
  - Self-improving systems

- **New Developer Skills**
  - Prompt engineering
  - System architecture

"Apps built in hours, production-ready in days—commonplace."

# Live Demo  
## Agentic Workflows in Action  

15 minutes to build two ed-tech apps live!  

---

# Demo Setup  
## Tools & Goals  

- **Tools**:  
  - *Bolt.new*: Base prototypes  
  - *Cursor*: Enhancements  
  - *Cline*: Automation  
  - *Playwright*: Testing  
- **Apps**:  
  1. Quiz tool with timer  
  2. Real-time note-taking app  

"From idea to reality—fast."

# Quiz App  
## Building with Bolt & Cursor  

1. *Bolt.new*: "A quiz app with multiple-choice and scores"  
2. Preview: Test it live  
3. *Cursor*: Add a 30-second timer  
4. *Playwright*: Verify timer works—no hallucinations  

::right::

> "Functional in minutes—imagine this in your classroom!"

# Note-Taking App  
## Collaborative & Smart  

1. *Bolt.new*: "Real-time collaborative notes"  
2. Preview: Sync live  
3. *Cursor + Cline*: Add comments feature  
4. *Cursor Composer*: Use screenshots to validate fixes  

"Let's add a feature together—what do you think?"
